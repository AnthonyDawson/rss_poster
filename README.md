# rss_poster

RSS Poster will take RSS feeds and generate WordPress posts automatically.

Configuring
------------
You must configure an XML file for each feed you want to use. Working samples are in streams directory.
When I have time I might create a proper configuration panel accessible from WordPress for now you need to get your hands dirty!

Images
--------
RSS Poster generates posts with pictures and some times its not possible to find a picture from the RSS feed
so RSS poster will use stock images. Images are found in the img directory and subdivided by category.
The Categories in img must match the categories in your WordPress imstallation and also in the XML configuration file. For each post generated for which a picture cannot be found  RSS poster will randomly select a stockpicture from img in the appropriate directory. You can add more pictures from sites like pixabay.com

If you have quations or get stuck you can email me aegdaw@gmail.com
